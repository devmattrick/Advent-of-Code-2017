# Day 2 - ~~Solidity~~ JavaScript
Solidity turns out not to be a good language to write this kind of stuff in. Today will be my cheat day (I now have 1 remaining), so I'm going to be using my language of choice instead.

> Total time spent: 1h 1m 44s (~31m 49s trying to use Solidity; ~29m 5s in JavaScript)
